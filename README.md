# Update : 20220304
As it happens we are in the process of migrating RMM systems from NAble to Datto

I am currently re-organizing my GitHub repos to better organize scripts according to their functions / implementation
 - If you are looking for the latest versions of RMM related scripts; please check this repo : https://github.com/CW-Khristos/RMM
 - Previous / Current copies of all scripts still exist under the "scripts" repo to avoid breaking links used in some scripts
