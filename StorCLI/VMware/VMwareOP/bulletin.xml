<!-- This template is for writing a bulletin to document any software
     released in the form of VIBs, or vSphere Installation Bundles.
     Every VIB must have at least one bulletin associated with it.
     The metadata in the bulletin is required to produce the
     publishable formats of software, namely hosted depots, offline
     bundles, and driver update CDs.  -->

<!-- This file 
     should be treated the same as any other source file and will be
     needed any time that the metadata for this bulletin or any derived
     metadata (e.g. metadata.zip) needs to change.  If additional
     bulletins are needed, they should be in separate files. -->

	<!-- The bulletin ID must be globally unique.  To facilitate
	     this, the ID must begin with the designated vendor code.
	     The vendor code will be assigned by VMware.  The rest of
	     the bulletin ID must be locally unique within that vendor
	     code.  The bulletin ID may incorporate information such
	     as product/component and version information, if
	     applicable.  The bulletin ID must not contain spaces. -->
